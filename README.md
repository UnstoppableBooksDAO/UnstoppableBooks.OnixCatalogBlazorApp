# OnixCatalogBlazorApp

## Overview
In the goal of creating UnstoppableBooksDAO, there needs to be a toolset available for decentralized publishing, since nothing is possible without one.  This project is an experimental tool to help decentralized authors/publishers/etc generate and organize the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.editeur.org/8/ONIX/">ONIX</a> metadata needed when submitting book metadata to vendors/retailers/etc.  In addition, this project also aims to showcase how one can sign the ONIX metadata with a decentralized ID (in this case, an Ethereum ID) in order to prove the validity of the metadata's origin.  An example of an ONIX file (with a signature) generated by this tool can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/UnstoppableBooksDAO/UnstoppableBooks.OnixCatalogBlazorApp/blob/main/OnixCatalogBlazorApp/wwwroot/sample-data/Secrets_of_Flukeman_by_Anonymous.xml">here</a>.

When the tool generates an ONIX file, a signature can be applied in one of two ways.  One, the user can use the <a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">Metamask plugin</a>, so that the application never needs to see the private key.  (NOTE: The user will need to create or have an Ethereum ID inside their Metamask wallet in order for this option to work.)  Two, by first visiting the Key Store page, the user can create a keystore with a private key, protected with a password, and the user can then use this keystore to sign the ONIX metadata.  A default private key and password are supplied on the Key Store page, as a way to demonstrate how to use this option - but they are only for demonstrative purposes.  WARNING: Do not use the default private key and password for signing real ONIX metadata, since they are not secure.

This project can easily be deployed by anyone through the creation of a Cloudflare account and by following these <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-blazor-site/">instructions</a>.
